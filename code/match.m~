function [matches] = match(sift1, sift2)
%match - This function matches two buntches of SIFT features by seeking the nearest neighbor of each feature.
%Consulted material:
%[1] - http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf
%in [1] it is recommended also to take into account the second nearest neighbour and ignore it if the distance is more than 0.8 between these two neighbours
% INPUT: 
% SIFT feature of the first image: sift1[128*n]
% SIFT feature of the second image: sift2[128*m]
% n may or may not equal to m
% OUTPUT:
% matches: M * 2 matrix, each row represents a match [index of p1, index of p2]
